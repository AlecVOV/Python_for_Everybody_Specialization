# Python for Everybody Specialization Progress

This repository documents my journey through the [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) offered by the University of Michigan on Coursera. The specialization introduces fundamental programming concepts, including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language.

## Specialization Overview

The specialization comprises the following courses:

1. **Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)**
   - *Description*: Introduces the basics of Python programming, including installation, writing simple programs, and understanding core concepts like variables, functions, and loops.
   - *Skills Acquired*:
     - Python Syntax and Semantics
     - Data Structures
     - Basic Programming Techniques

2. **Python Data Structures**
   - *Description*: Explores data structures in Python, such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples, and their applications in storing and manipulating data.
   - *Skills Acquired*:
     - Data Organization
     - File Handling
     - Key/Value Data Storage

3. **Using Python to Access Web Data**
   - *Description*: Covers techniques for retrieving data from the web, including web scraping, working with APIs, and parsing XML/JSON data.
   - *Skills Acquired*:
     - Regular Expressions
     - HTTP Protocol Understanding
     - Web Data Retrieval

4. **Using Databases with Python**
   - *Description*: Introduces database concepts, SQL, and how to interact with databases using Python.
   - *Skills Acquired*:
     - Database Management
     - Object-Oriented Python
     - Data Visualization with APIs

5. **Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python**
   - *Description*: Applies the skills learned in previous courses to develop a project involving data retrieval, processing, and visualization.
   - *Skills Acquired*:
     - Project Development
     - Data Analysis
     - Visualization Techniques
